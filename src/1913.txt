31 Aug–25 Oct 1913 Independent Western Thrace
Following the Greek withdrawal from Gümülcine (Komotini) in Western Thrace in favor of Bulgaria, pro-Ottoman forces seized control of the city. The Ottoman Empire—which had not yet signed a treaty with Bulgaria—supported the rebels, who declared the Provisional Government of Western Thrace on 25 September 1913. Ottoman support ended when Bulgaria signed the Treaty of Constantinople four days later, after which the Ottomans withdrew their forces and the Bulgarians took over.
