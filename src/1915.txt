German submarine U-20 torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in the North Atlantic Ocean off the southwest coast of Ireland, sinking her.

Although she was a British ship carrying munitions and the German Embassy in Washington had issued a warning implying that she might be attacked, the sinking shocked the United States and helped galvanize opinion against Germany. In response, on 9 September 1915, Germany ordered the restriction of U-boat attacks to ships that were confirmed to be British, with no actions against passenger liners permitted at all.in wikipedia
